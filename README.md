# Water-Kaolinite-LAMMPS
This project contains the LAMMPS simulation data generated from MSI2LMP to simulate 17k ppm CsCl between Kaolinite layer using ClayFF force field. The result files are in post directory, including the video created using OVITO. The force field can be obtained from MSI2LMP repository on LAMMPS github. This force field is outdated but it works fine with the MSI2LMP, format wise.

This is an unfinished work. The simulation is still broken, since there are bond and angle lost due to transfer from water simulation to kaolinite layer. Therefore, this work should not be used for real cases.
